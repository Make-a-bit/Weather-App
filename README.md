# Weather-App
 
## Notes
This is my Weather App project which main purpose was to learn JS, HTML and CSS. It uses two different API gateways for fetching the weather forecast based on geolocation data. 

For now, you have only two options: 
* Code review
* Try it out yourself

If your intend is to see the app functionality in action, you have to register an account for the followin API providers:
* https://opencagedata.com/
* https://openweathermap.org/

Both API provider accounts are completely free for testing purposes and have limitations of 1000 to 2000 API calls daily. After you have completed your registration for these services, please add your API keys to script.js file at lines 1 and 2. Otherwise your options are limited to code review only.
